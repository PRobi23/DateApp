## Questions

#### Please answer the following questions:

* How long did you spend on the homework test?

> 6-7 hours

* What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the assignment, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

> Exactly the same Ui as in the mockup. I would need the hearts svg for example from the dialog, proper colors etc. for that. I would add the age filter also, but how can I apply the filter on the API? It's not mentioned there only the gender.

* Which parts did you spend the most time with?

> First I wanted to the swap with viewpager after 1 hour I realized I could do it with detectDragGestures

* How did you find the test overall? Weâ€™d love to hear your suggestions on how we can improve.

> It was fun, but 2 hours is definitely not enough to make it properly work. Just a small improvment: The dialog shown is missing from the description :)
